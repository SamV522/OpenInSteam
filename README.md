# Open In Steam
A minimal chrome extension for opening steam links, in steam.

### What does it do
This extension will add an option to your context menu to open valid links in steam, and an action button you can use to open the steam web page you're on in steam.

### How to use
To use it, simply right click a valid link, and select "Open in Steam", or, while you're on the page, click on the Open In Steam action button.

### Note
There are options to control whether the old tab is closed when you open the link in steam via the right click context menu, or the action button.

This will only work if the URL leads to any:
- http(s)://store.steampowered.com/*
- http(s)://steamcommunity.com/*
